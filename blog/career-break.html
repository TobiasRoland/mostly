			<h1>I quit my job to study what I'm passionate about</h1>
			<div class="inactive">09 November 2019</div>
			<p>I’m taking the last months of 2019 off to study functional programming, scala and category theory. I had my last day of work last week. So what now?</p>

			<p>The day to day plan is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>two and a half/three hours of study in the morning</li>
				<li>a mid day break with room for music and exercise</li>
				<li>two and a half/three hours of study in the afternoon</li>
			</ul>

			<p>All dedicated to only doing things that I care about. Maybe after a few weeks I will find that I need to divert course, but for now the ambition is to focus on Scala as a
			   primary language, with a side serving of Haskell and a sprinkling of F# as teaching aide. And a few palate cleansers of methodology texts that I’ve wanted to read.</p>

			<h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>
			<p>As you can imagine, quitting my job with nothing else lined up was not an easy choice to make. On one hand, I had great coworkers I loved and a stable job that was
			   providing a stable income, but on the other hand… well. I intend to write a longer blog post about this when I am less blog-shy (you’re reading my first blog… ever!), but
			   in short, I want to take active control of the direction of my career, to steer it in a direction I think I will be happy with. That - for me - required taking some time
			   out to explore what I am actually passionate about.</p>

			<p>My biggest fear for this project is failing to my overcome my procrastination.</p>
