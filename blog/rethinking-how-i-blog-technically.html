				Rethinking how i blog (technically)
			</h1>
			<p>27 July 2025</p>
			<p>I recently got to experience my own blog from a bad network connection, and
			   I found it unbearably slow. Looking into fixing that, I realised I'd accidentally over-engineered myself into a corner.</p>
			<p>I previously used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate this blog. It was great. Convenient, nice, it looked nice, but as a (very) infrequent blogger, it
			   always felt like a lot of ceremony for a
			   few hundred
			   lines of HTML. Looking at my own blog's codebase felt like I was abandoning my normal engineering practice, which in turn
			   made me feel less interested in blogging.</p>
			<p>As of late, I've been actively thinking a lot about my axiomatic beliefs around programming. And I think at the core of my beliefs is that there is joy to be
			   found in reducing cognitive overhead. Abstracting away HTML didn't do that for me.
			</p>
			<p>So, rather than obsess over a state of framework-perfection I'll never achieve, I hope to find a certain kind of mental peace
			   in the blunt simplicity of hand-rolled CSS and HTML - as a sort of 'brutalist' website design choice.
			</p>

			<p>If, in the future, I find a great passion for frontend design or interest in big frameworks, maybe I'll revisit.</p>
