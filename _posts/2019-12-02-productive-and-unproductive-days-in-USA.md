I'm on my third week in California now, with about another week before I have 
to set sail towards the British Isles again. 

The last two weeks have been busy. Not because
I've been extremely studious as I'd hoped, but rather, because so
many interesting things have been happening during my stay in North California.

## The productive days
I have had extremely productive days. For instance, I blasted through about
half of the red book ([Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)) 
in a day. This is a lot quicker than I anticipated, considering
the page count. Two things helped me:

1. my previous job role was
a scala role, so I've used many of the concepts "in anger"; going
back and confirming my foundational knowledge was therefore not that hard
2. I solved all the exercises for the book prior to reading it on 
[Scala Exercises: FP in Scala](https://www.scala-exercises.org/fp_in_scala/) -
 most of them when I was extremely bored on terrible wifi on my 11 hour flight to the States.

At a more, uh, _considerate_... let's say... pace, I'm also making progress 
through Bartosz Milewski's 
[Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/)
 (book/free pdf [here](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/releases/tag/v1.3.0)) 
 and the accompanying/complimentary series video lectures he's got freely available on youtube. 
 This is an absolutely amazing resource. Initially, I was purely reading the book and ignoring the
existence of the video lectures, but once I hit 3<sup>rd</sup> chapter, I realized I had to 
change my study approach - this kind of material requires a bit more
cognitive effort. I've now got a physical notebook with which I'm scribbling along to the videos. 
I don't expect the notebook will be super valuable to me in the future for brushing up since
my handwriting is more of an interpretive performance in the moment rather 
than a series of decipherable human alphanumerical characters, but as a teaching aid, regurgitating 
the information onto a page helps me mentally model the material. Interestingly, chapter 4 on Kleisli arrows 
was much easier to read - I think it was the density of information in chapter 3 that scared me,
as a _lot_ of concepts are introduced in but a few paragraphs.



## The unproductive days


California, as compared to London, is a very different climate and geography indeed. This place is absolutely
gorgeous, and with two dogs in the house whose greatest goal in life seems to be
to FETCH THAT BALL no matter how far into the pacific ocean I throw it, I've spent a fair
amount of time on the beaches:
