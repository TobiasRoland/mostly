I'm taking the last months of 2019 off to study 
functional programming, scala and category theory. I had my last day of work last week. So what now?

![](/images/functional_scala_haskell_books.jpg)

The day to day plan is:

* two and a half/three hours of study in the morning
* a mid day break with room for music and exercise
* two and a half/three hours of study in the afternoon

All dedicated to only doing things that I care about. Maybe
after a few weeks I will find that I need to divert course, but for now
the ambition is to focus on Scala as a primary language, with a side serving
of Haskell and a sprinkling of F# as teaching aide. And a few palate cleansers
of methodology texts that I've wanted to read.


## But why? 
As you can imagine, quitting my job with nothing
else lined up was not an easy choice to make.

On one hand, I had great coworkers I loved and a stable job that was 
providing a stable income, but on the other hand... well. I intend to write a 
longer blog post about this when I am less blog-shy 
(you're reading my first blog... ever!), but in short, 
I want to take *active control* of the direction of my career, to steer it in
a direction I think I will be happy with. That - for me - required taking 
some time out to explore what I am actually passionate about. 

## Fears and goals
    
My biggest fear for this project is failing to my overcome my procrastination. To combat it, I have some things 
that I hope will keep me motivated and on track. I might adjust these over time, for now though, 
I've set my initial values to the following:

##### Public goal setting

  One of the best ways to overcome procrastination for me is to
  make myself accountable to someone else. I doubt many people will
  read this blog, yet just the act of writing up this text feels like
  I have made myself accountable - I don't want to let future Tobias down when
  he reads this back!

##### Daily study journal updates

  This should give me some motivation to ensure I have something to write. These
  won't be ful-on blog posts, just one or two paragraphs such as: 
  
  "Today I read chapers 3 & 4 of 
  Scala with Cats, and chapter 5 of Category Theory for Programmers - I thought I would
  get further but ...  so tomorrow I will try ... to see if that will make my progress
  through the material easier"

##### Two books in progress at all times

  Try to get at least **1 chapter** from each book each day.
  Hopefully reading 'lighter'/softer material like the Bob Martin books or The Pragmatic Programmer should allow me
  to never feel like I'm stuck hitting my head against the wall.
 
##### A daily schedule

  I might do a blog post on schedules and time management as I find them
  a super fascinating topic. My plan is to do 2-3 hours of studying, long recreational break and then 2-3 hours of studying.
  This one isn't iron-clad, but diversion from the formula should be accounted for in the daily
  study-journal updates.
  
  In terms of how I study, that's one of the things I really would like to experiment
  with. I have previously used the pomodoro-technique which really helps, but
  am keen to explore other study techniques.

##### Uh... misc?

And then of course, the fact that the goal is to only spend time studying what I am interested in.
Should I find that a book or resource isn't working for me, I will change it out. 

I imagine I will return to these goals every now and then to adjust them.

## Let's go!

And here thought I wouldn't have anything to write about, yet now I've started typing, I find I want to write 
a lot more about everything. Oh well, I'll leave that for future blog posts!
